```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 10.5.1
How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame).

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
print(mtcars)
class(mtcars)
#we can make data as tibbles by using as_tibble() and check its class by class()
as_tibble(mtcars)
class(as_tibble(mtcars))
```
Tibbles only prints the toppest few rows of the data and the class of each columns.

## 10.5.2

Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. What is different? Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#df does partial matching
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
#df returns a factor
df[, "xyz"]
#returns data frame
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]

#tibble doesn't do partial matching
dftibble <- as_tibble(df)
dftibble$x
#tibble returns a data frame
dftibble[, "xyz"]
#tibbles have class in top of each column
dftibble[, c("abc", "xyz")]
```

## 10.5.3
If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
var <- "abc"
dftibble[[var]]
dftibble[var]
```
## 10.5.4
Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:

1. Extracting the variable called 1.

2. Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.

3. Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.

4. Renaming the columns to one, two and three.

```{r}
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
#1. Extracting the variable called 1.
annoying$`1`
#2. Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.
ggplot(annoying, aes(x = `1`, y = `2`)) + geom_point()
#3. Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.
annoying[["3"]] <- annoying$`2` / annoying$`1`
#4. Renaming the columns to one, two and three.
annoying <- rename(annoying, one = `1`, two = `2`, three = `3`)
glimpse(annoying)
```
## 10.5.5
What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?

enframe() converts named atomic vectors or lists to two-column data frames. For unnamed vectors, the natural sequence is used as name column.

The usage is: enframe(x, name = "name", value = "value")

```{r}
enframe(c(a = 5, b = 7))
```

## 10.5.6
What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?
```{r}
#use print.tbl_df
?print.tbl_df
#examples
print(as_tibble(mtcars), n = 5)
```

## 12.6.1
pre-code
```{r}
who1 <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE)
who1
who1 %>% 
  count(key)
who2 <- who1 %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel"))
who2
who3 <- who2 %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
who3
who3 %>% 
  count(new)
who4 <- who3 %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3)
who5 <- who4 %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who5
who %>%
  gather(code, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(code = stringr::str_replace(code, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>%
  separate(code, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
```
1. In this case study I set na.rm = TRUE just to make it easier to check that we had the correct values. Is this reasonable? Think about how missing values are represented in this dataset. Are there implicit missing values? What’s the difference between an NA and zero?

```{r}
who1 %>%
  filter(cases == 0) %>%
  nrow()

gather(who, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases") %>%
  group_by(country, year)  %>%
  mutate(missing = is.na(cases)) %>%
  select(country, year, missing) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country, year) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```

2. What happens if you neglect the mutate() step? (mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")))
```{r}
who3a <- who1 %>%
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_")
filter(who3a, new == "newrel") %>% head()
```

3. I claimed that iso2 and iso3 were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.
```{r}
select(who3, country, iso2, iso3) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)
```

4. For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualisation of the data.
```{r}
who5 %>%
  group_by(country, year, sex) %>%
  filter(year > 1995) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  unite(country_sex, country, sex, remove = FALSE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, group = country_sex, colour = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```
